## 1. `data_fetcher.py`
**Purpose:**  
This module is responsible for fetching data, such as historical stock prices, financial metrics, or market indices. It could integrate with APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.

**Tasks:**
- Implement functions to fetch data (e.g., stock price, volume, historical returns).
- Include error handling for API failures or data inconsistencies.
- Provide data caching or retrieval from local storage for efficiency.

---

## 2. `optimizer.py`
**Purpose:**  
This is where the core optimization logic resides. It handles portfolio construction using various algorithms, such as mean-variance optimization, risk parity, or other advanced portfolio management strategies.

**Tasks:**
- Define optimization algorithms (e.g., Markowitz, Black-Litterman).
- Implement risk-return calculations (e.g., expected returns, covariance matrices).
- Allow configuration for constraints like asset weight limits, diversification, and risk tolerance.

---

## 3. `risk_assessment.py`
**Purpose:**  
This module focuses on assessing and calculating the risk of a portfolio. It evaluates potential volatility, Value at Risk (VaR), stress testing, and other metrics.

**Tasks:**
- Implement risk metrics like Sharpe ratio, standard deviation, beta, drawdown, etc.
- Create tools to perform scenario analysis or stress testing under various market conditions.
- Offer visualization tools (e.g., risk-return scatter plots, correlation matrices).

---

## 4. `backtest.py`
**Purpose:**  
This module enables the backtesting of the portfolio optimizer. It simulates the performance of the portfolio over historical data to assess the effectiveness of the optimization.

**Tasks:**
- Implement backtesting logic to simulate trading over historical data.
- Include transaction costs, rebalancing intervals, and slippage in backtests.
- Provide performance metrics (e.g., total return, maximum drawdown, alpha, beta).
- Generate performance reports (graphs, tables) for easy evaluation.

---

## 5. `main.py`
**Purpose:**  
The entry point of the application. This module integrates all the functionalities by coordinating between the different modules (data fetching, optimization, risk assessment, and backtesting). It could include CLI or web-based inputs to make the framework interactive.

**Tasks:**
- Provide an interface to input parameters (e.g., asset universe, optimization constraints).
- Fetch and prepare data for optimization.
- Run the optimizer and risk assessment.
- Backtest the resulting portfolio and generate reports.
- Allow for output of results in a readable format (e.g., graphs, portfolio allocations, etc.).

---

## 6. `requirements.txt`
**Purpose:**  
Contains the necessary Python libraries and dependencies needed for the framework to function.

**Contents:**
- `numpy` for numerical calculations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualizations.
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning (optional, if using for predictive models).
- `yfinance` or another finance-related API client for data fetching.
- `cvxpy` or other optimization libraries for portfolio optimization.
- `pytest` for testing (if applicable).

---

## Additional Considerations:
- **Testing:** Develop unit tests for each module to ensure correctness and robustness.
- **Documentation:** Write clear documentation for how to use the framework and what each module does.
- **Modularity:** Ensure that each module is independent, allowing users to integrate them as needed or replace them with custom implementations.

This structure provides a clear framework for building a portfolio optimization tool, with flexibility for adding advanced features or customizations as needed.
